# Overview
I started this project to learn more about databases and using/storing them in the cloud. I'm using MongoDB to host my database and the information inside it,
and I'm using the pymongo library to be able to use python as my language of choice to interace with the MongoDB database.
The database I created stores information about books such as their title and author. I created it to immitate the website MyAnimeList, where you can add a
current status to the book such as: "Completed", "Reading", or "Planned to read" as well as an overall score for the book. This would allow you to query your top 5
book or all books that you have rated a 10 out of 10. Additional functionality would need to be implemented to allow for these queries but for now you can add,
delete, and update books and their ratings in the database.
